    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">
    &emsp;During my 2 years of game programming career, I have come up with many game ideas, I would go to work in the day and work on my projects in the night. Life was fine until I realized I had no idea how to make a game fun, that's why I decided to go on a journey to Falmouth to learn game design. The course is great, and the lecturers offer a lot of advice and insights into the game design process. We learned a few things about project management and prototyping different types of games that have social impacts and are not purely entertainment.
    <br/>&emsp;This project here is Gallos Kernow, which means "Cornwall's strength". It's a council interest project that aims to help teach primary school children resilience in civil emergencies, it's kinda like a client project where we meet a member of the council to discuss promising features. My team was rather imbalanced in terms of disciplines, we had 5 designers, 2 programmers and one artist, this was mainly because the course leader decided that teams should be formed in a free-for-all. That being said I'm glad to have met the folks in my team, they are some of the chillest people I know.
    <br/>&emsp;At the start of the project, our team divided members into different research criteria, I was in charge of gathering knowledge about how children from 6 to 12 years old process information. I gathered studies from multiple sources, summarised their findings and comprised a list of good gamification practices that we can have in the game.
    <br/>&emsp;Due to the lack of programmers in the team, I also had to fulfil the programmer role. The gameplay features weren't technically challenging, the only problem was the volume of work that we had to divide between the two programmers. For my part, I had to implement various features such as a resource production system similar to those in an idle game, a medical quiz minigame for medical scenarios, and a system where scenarios are randomized without repeating. I didn't encounter any problem understanding the other programmer's code, I offered him a few of my technical advice throughout the development process. Additionally, I was "on call" to fix every single bug that spawned in the game, most bugs just take one or two minutes though I had to fix some bugs of the other programmer who was occasionally busy. I love fixing bugs, did I mention that I love fixing bugs?
    <br/>&emsp;Overall, it was a pretty interesting experience working with people of another culture with different perspectives. I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to my future endeavour in the UK.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">
      &emsp;This one is a pretty interesting small prototype I made for one of the gamejams in the course. The theme for the jam was "Small scale, large scope", and after a while of shuffling different potential ideas, I settled on the grand mechanics of combining sigils into spells. This is an extremely interesting mechanic that is not very well explored in modern games, probably due to how complex they are to learn or how slow they are to cast in complex games. Old games like Tyranny and Two Worlds have attempted the sigil mechanic but it was not the highlight of them and hasn't been fully explored yet. I have solved some of the problems that they might have had with expanding the mechanics itself and noted them down for future reference.
      <br/>&emsp;During the development process, I learned about a pretty handy algorithm for recognizing combinations regardless of order, it's Aho-Corasick and no doubt is one of the most valuable knowledge I have learnt for game programming. I also have the readied code to confidently make any puzzle minigame as side content for live service games like Arknight and Reverse 1999.
      <br/>&emsp;Due to the limited time of one week, I only managed to create a small puzzle game with 5 levels. I think it was pretty cool, my peers seem to agree. I pulled some inspiration from Pokemon Red/Blue's ice-sliding puzzle and old puzzle games like Sokoban. The levels are designed so that each one teaches the player something about the mechanics as well as challenges their lateral thinking ability.
      <br/>&emsp;In retrospect, I think that the most time-consuming part is my tendency to try to make the initial design perfect like the beginning of a waterfall project, I realized afterwards that it's time-consuming and is not as effective as the iterative design process. For the game, I think that it will be the 3rd project that I will be invested in for its potential.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">
      &emsp;My two years working as a programmer at NoPowerUp was a very memorable experience for me. You know how companies often say "We are like a family". For me, it did feel like a big family there, everyone was really friendly and knowledgeable.
      <br/>&emsp;After my brief internship, I was included in a new company project that is an idle game about simulating the production of dairy products from the farm to the factories. In the early stages of the project, I was the only programmer in the team, I was given an idle 2D game framework by our partner overseas and tasked with implementing a 3D grey box project with basic idle game features like resource production when the device is offline, check factory details, upgrades and stats, and different factory productivity modifiers. There were also a few experimental features that were suggested to me by my product manager like a secondary resource that is milk, the ability to turn off automation to control the flow of milk consumption and various minor UI changes. The workload was huge but I didn't pale in the face of adversity, I sorted which tasks were core, did research and implemented them, and ensured the code was easy to read, maintainable and scalable. After some additional artists and programmers were included, the project started to really come together.
      <br/>&emsp;During my time working on the project, I also got an abundance of opportunities to communicate professionally with our overseas partner East Side Games, mostly we would communicate about game events' balancing data, potential framework or game bugs and discuss future technical changes. About one year after I joined, the company started expanding the office space and hired new interns, I was assigned as an intern supervisor who could answer their questions about the company project structure and codebase. I had a pretty good rapport with all my coworkers, especially the testers, which is pretty rare for a programmer. I love fixing bugs, I'm the go-to guy when it comes to bugs in the project, and testers love reporting bugs to me since I know who is responsible and can fix them quickly. When I was not too busy working on new features or fixing bugs, I would write unit tests for different parts of the game to ensure there would be no recurring bugs. The testers also ask me to implement debug tools like money or unlock cheats into the dev version of the game to speed up the testing process.
      <br/>&emsp;In the end, it's my undying ambition that kept me from being contented and so I left NoPowerUp to seek new perspectives, new knowledge and new opportunities to make games I want to see actualized.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just" >
      &emsp;Working on Super Space Rhythm is a moment in my life that I can always look fondly upon. Our university required a mandatory internship in a big company so I and my two friends decided to take Gameloft HAN's summer internship. We were briefly walked through openGL and box2D and then given exercises to do. After that, we were divided into teams for the internship gamejam. I and my friends were in separate teams but I managed to convince them otherwise on the condition our team was one member short.
      <br/>&emsp;We had one month to make our game, two of my friends quickly got to the drawing board while I put together a simple game engine in C++ inspired by Unity with an asset loader, render pipeline, text rendering, scene loader and input manager... Afterwards, we decided on the idea of a rhythm game where the player has to act on the beat, this includes attacking, evading and switching forms. Riding the wave of enthusiasm, I got to adding features like map random, core game loop, health, damage, powerup and controllable character state machine. I then wrote documentation for the engine so that my friends could easily import assets and create scenes.
      <br/>&emsp;After coding a rudimentary AI system using a finite state machine, I designed a few simple enemies, there is the knight who gets a shield every few seconds, there is the wizard who shoots projectiles, and a lizard man who places bombs on the floor... I then went on to design different levels and power-ups with my friends, and we had a great time. The most memorable level to me was the explosive level where there was a bunch of TNT that exploded when hit or touched and then tons of lizard mobs that placed pressure bombs all over the place as well. After beating a level, the player can choose between 3 buffs and then move to the next level. The 4th level is a final boss, I didn't code it but I did help my friend with troubleshooting from time to time, the boss is a real challenge with 4 different states with a unique bullet rain pattern.
      <br/>&emsp;In the end, I and my friends presented our game together, the supervisors and the audience were very impressed, we got first place in the internship gamejam and were very proud of our achievement.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">At the time, I was really interested in various methods of game design and one of the YouTube channels I would frequent for knowledge is Game Maker Toolkit. Having learnt that they host an annual gamejam, I decided to participate with a friend. That year's theme was "Out of Control" so we designed a game about nagging slacking employees called "Slack Slayer".
      <br>The game was made in 48 hours in Unity Game Engine using free assets on the internet. It's a fairly simple but polished game and we enjoyed making it. It helped us measure our game-making skills and we were surprised that we could make such a game in a short period.</p>

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">Jappo (Prototype) is a project that originated from my bachelor graduation thesis, it's about learning how to write Japanese words and actualizing those words as actions or events in the game world to solve puzzles or fight enemies.
      <br/>Currently, the prototype has handwriting recognition and actualize mechanics, I'm planning on adding sound recognition in the future to let the player train their pronunciation.
      <br/>I am currently putting this project on pause until I can find a new VR device but no doubt I will be making this into a full game in the future.</p>
