    <h3><u>Milk Farm Tycoon</u></h3>
    <b>Featured Roles</b>
    <p class="just">UI/Gameplay programmer, Bridge engineer, Intern supervisor, Game design, Game testing, Tool programming.</p>
    <b>My experience</b>
    <p class="just">Working at NoPowerUp was a memorable experience for me. You know how corpo often say "we are like a family". For me, it did feel like a big family there, everyone was really friendly and knowledgeable.<br/>
      Milk Farm Tycoon was my very first project at NPU. The moment I finished my internship, I was instantly included in the pre-production team for Milk Farm Tycoon where I had to analyze and implement a complex codebase given by our overseas partner.<br/>
      About 50% of the game UI was put together by me, this includes every upgrade popup, quest indicators, dialogue/tutorial scenes and time-limited events.<br/>
      Here I also discovered my talent and enjoyment for debugging. I was the goto guy for bug report, I would quickly identify the problem and relay it to the culprit. One of the craziest bug I have encountered was when iOS push an update that make Unity trigger 2 OnApplicationPause and this disables all UI elements everytime the player minimize the app. My peers couldn't figure out why but I did (ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง.

    <h3><u>Super Space Rhythm</u></h3>
    <b>Featured Roles</b>
    <p class="just">Engine Developer, Enemy AI Programmer, RPG Developer, Level Designer</p>
    <b>My experience</b>
    <p class="just" >Working on Super Space Rhythm is a moment in my life that I can always look fondly upon. Our university required a mandatory internship in a big company so I and my two friends decided to take Gameloft HAN's summer internship.<br/>
      We learnt a lot about the basics of game development like how to build a render pipeline using OpenGL, implement shaders and apply physics. After that, we were divided into teams to make a game in a month for the internship gamejam. At first, my friends and I were placed in separate teams but due to my outstanding negotiation skills, the supervisor decided to let me and my friends be in the same team albeit one person short compared to other teams.<br/>
      We had a lot of fun making a game we would enjoy. In the end, we managed to take home first place in Gameloft HAN's internship gamejam.</p>

    <h3><u>Slack Slayer</u></h3>
    <b>Featured Roles</b>
    <p class="just">Game Developer</p>
    <b>My experience</b>
    <p class="just">At the time, I was really interested in various methods of game design and one of the YouTube channels I would frequent for knowledge is Game Maker Toolkit. Having learnt that they host an annual gamejam, I decided to participate with a friend. That year's theme was "Out of Control" so we designed a game about nagging slacking employees called "Slack Slayer".<br>
      The game was made in 48 hours in Unity Game Engine using free assets on the internet. It's a fairly simple but polished game and we enjoyed making it. It helped us measure our game-making skills and we were surprised that we could make such a game in a short period.</p>

    <h3><u>Jappo (Prototype)</u></h3>
    <b>Featured Roles</b>
    <p class="just">Data Engineer, VR Game Developer, Game Designer</p>
    <b>My experience</b>
    <p class="just">Jappo (Prototype) is a project that originated from my bachelor graduation thesis, it's about learning how to write Japanese words and actualizing those words as actions or events in the game world to solve puzzles or fight enemies.<br/>
      Currently, the prototype has handwriting recognition and actualize mechanics, I'm planning on adding sound recognition in the future to let the player train their pronunciation.<br/>
      I am currently putting this project on pause until I can find a new VR device but no doubt I will be making this into a full game in the future.</p>
