    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">
    &emsp;During my 2 years of game programming career, I have come up with many game ideas, I would go to work in the day and work on my projects in the night. Life was fine until I realized I had no idea how to make a game fun, that's why I decided to go on a journey to Falmouth to learn game design. The course is great, and the lecturers offer a lot of advice and insights into the game design process. We learned a few things about project management and prototyping different types of games that have social impacts and are not purely entertainment.
    <br/>&emsp;This project here is Gallos Kernow, which means "Cornwall's strength". It's a council interest project that aims to help teach primary school children resilience in civil emergencies, it's kinda like a client project where we meet a member of the council to discuss promising features. My team was rather imbalanced in terms of disciplines, we had 5 designers, 2 programmers and one artist, this was mainly because the course leader decided that teams should be formed in a free-for-all. That being said I'm glad to have met the folks in my team, they are some of the chillest people I know.
    <br/>&emsp;At the start of the project, our team divided members into different research criteria, I was in charge of gathering knowledge about how children from 6 to 12 years old process information. I gathered studies from multiple sources, summarised their findings and comprised a list of good gamification practices that we can have in the game.
    <br/>&emsp;Due to the lack of programmers in the team, I also had to fulfil the programmer role. The gameplay features weren't technically challenging, the only problem was the volume of work that we had to divide between the two programmers. For my part, I had to implement various features such as a resource production system similar to those in an idle game, a medical quiz minigame for medical scenarios, and a system where scenarios are randomized without repeating. I didn't encounter any problem understanding the other programmer's code, I offered him a few of my technical advice throughout the development process. Additionally, I was "on call" to fix every single bug that spawned in the game, most bugs just take one or two minutes though I had to fix some bugs of the other programmer who was occasionally busy. I love fixing bugs, did I mention that I love fixing bugs?
    <br/>&emsp;Overall, it was a pretty interesting experience working with people of another culture with different perspectives. I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to my future endeavour in the UK.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">
      &emsp;This one is a pretty interesting small prototype I made for one of the gamejams in the course. The theme for the jam was "Small scale, large scope", and after a while of shuffling different potential ideas, I settled on the grand mechanics of combining sigils into spells. This is an extremely interesting mechanic that is not very well explored in modern games, probably due to how complex they are to learn or how slow they are to cast in complex games. Old games like Tyranny and Two Worlds have attempted the sigil mechanic but it was not the highlight of them and hasn't been fully explored yet. I have solved some of the problems that they might have had with expanding the mechanics itself and noted them down for future reference.
      <br/>&emsp;During the development process, I learned about a pretty handy algorithm for recognizing combinations regardless of order, it's Aho-Corasick and no doubt is one of the most valuable knowledge I have learnt for game programming. I also have the readied code to confidently make any puzzle minigame as side content for live service games like Arknight and Reverse 1999.
      <br/>&emsp;Due to the limited time of one week, I only managed to create a small puzzle game with 5 levels. I think it was pretty cool, my peers seem to agree. I pulled some inspiration from Pokemon Red/Blue's ice-sliding puzzle and old puzzle games like Sokoban. The levels are designed so that each one teaches the player something about the mechanics as well as challenges their lateral thinking ability.
      <br/>&emsp;In retrospect, I think that the most time-consuming part is my tendency to try to make the initial design perfect like the beginning of a waterfall project, I realized afterwards that it's time-consuming and is not as effective as the iterative design process. For the game, I think that it will be the 3rd project that I will be invested in for its potential.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">
      Working at NoPowerUp was a memorable experience for me. You know how corpo often say "we are like a family". For me, it did feel like a big family there, everyone was really friendly and knowledgeable.
      <br/>Milk Farm Tycoon was my very first project at NPU. The moment I finished my internship, I was instantly included in the pre-production team for Milk Farm Tycoon where I had to analyze and implement a complex codebase given by our overseas partner.
      <br/>About 50% of the game UI was put together by me, this includes every upgrade popup, quest indicators, dialogue/tutorial scenes and time-limited events.
      <br/>Here I also discovered my talent and enjoyment for debugging. I was the goto guy for bug report, I would quickly identify the problem and relay it to the culprit. One of the craziest bug I have encountered was when iOS push an update that make Unity trigger 2 OnApplicationPause and this disables all UI elements everytime the player minimize the app. My peers couldn't figure out why but I did (ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง.

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just" >Working on Super Space Rhythm is a moment in my life that I can always look fondly upon. Our university required a mandatory internship in a big company so I and my two friends decided to take Gameloft HAN's summer internship.
      <br/>We learnt a lot about the basics of game development like how to build a render pipeline using OpenGL, implement shaders and apply physics. After that, we were divided into teams to make a game in a month for the internship gamejam. At first, my friends and I were placed in separate teams but due to my outstanding negotiation skills, the supervisor decided to let me and my friends be in the same team albeit one person short compared to other teams.
      <br/>We had a lot of fun making a game we would enjoy. In the end, we managed to take home first place in Gameloft HAN's internship gamejam.</p>

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">At the time, I was really interested in various methods of game design and one of the YouTube channels I would frequent for knowledge is Game Maker Toolkit. Having learnt that they host an annual gamejam, I decided to participate with a friend. That year's theme was "Out of Control" so we designed a game about nagging slacking employees called "Slack Slayer".
      <br>The game was made in 48 hours in Unity Game Engine using free assets on the internet. It's a fairly simple but polished game and we enjoyed making it. It helped us measure our game-making skills and we were surprised that we could make such a game in a short period.</p>

    <h3 style="padding-top: 0;">My experience</h3>
    <p class="just">Jappo (Prototype) is a project that originated from my bachelor graduation thesis, it's about learning how to write Japanese words and actualizing those words as actions or events in the game world to solve puzzles or fight enemies.
      <br/>Currently, the prototype has handwriting recognition and actualize mechanics, I'm planning on adding sound recognition in the future to let the player train their pronunciation.
      <br/>I am currently putting this project on pause until I can find a new VR device but no doubt I will be making this into a full game in the future.</p>
